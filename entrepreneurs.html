                                We are aiming to engage with the brightest MVNO stars of tomorrow. Qualifying to do so puts the highest of expectations on us as a partner to be able to not only fund your journey but to support you in as many aspects as there possibly are along the way.  
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-sm font-light text-charcoal mb-2 leading-5">
                                But how do we find a good fit? Just as on the dance floor in elementary school we urge you to evaluate and examine us as a potential partner. Don’t be shy, ask us the bold questions already now, that will make our partnership easier to evolve further down the road.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-sm font-light text-charcoal mb-2 leading-5">
                                Speaking of partnership, we believe in the power of connections with the leading players in the industry. As a consequence, we have invested vast amounts of time and screening to identify and establish strategic partnerships with what we believe to be the best out there in every corner of the MVNO industry. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-sm font-light text-charcoal mb-2 leading-5">
                                We are proud of providing that to the companies where we invest. Therefore, and as a part of the evaluation process of us we encourage you to also reach out to some of the entrepreneurs and industry players that we have already partnered with to hear what they have to say about us.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-sm font-light text-charcoal leading-5">
                                If we turn the arrow over, pointing to your direction, we are looking for great people with a determination and passion to change and challenge the industry. Our desired state is where there is already a team in place to set the sails. It will be windy and quick change of weather so a previous entrepreneurial experience is not a must, but definitely a plus.
                            </p>

                                However, if you are a solo entrepreneur with an idea that will break grounds and new to the game, we are of course all ears. It just might take a little more of mutual evaluation before we, potentially enters the dance floor.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-sm font-light text-charcoal mb-2 leading-5">
                                MVNO is at the core of what we do. With a strong conviction that the development of MNVO’s across aspects are healthy for the overall development of the Telecom industry we are here to fuel the development of the most interesting start-ups.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-sm font-light text-charcoal mb-2 leading-5">
                                We have decided to keep our investment scope tight as we want to be an active investor in the companies where we get the opportunity to invest. Why, we simply think that over time that will differentiate us as the best fit for MVNO entrepreneurs when deciding on investors to support your growth journey. However, and having said that we are open for opportunities that are adjacent to being an MVNO. What are the boundaries of that definition, maybe it is up to your creativity or imagination to decide. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-sm font-light text-charcoal leading-5">
                                Our focus in the life cycle is early. To maybe oversimplify reality, we see four distinct phases of an MVNO start-up. 1. Pre-MNO wholesale agreement, 2. Having accomplished a signed MNO wholesale agreement, 3. post-MNO wholesale agreement, ready to launch operations and a clear go to market plan at hand, 4. MVNO successfully launched, proof of concept at hand, scaling ahead.
