                                But how do we find a good fit? Just as on the dance floor in elementary school we urge you to evaluate and examine us as a potential partner. Don’t be shy, ask us the bold questions already now, that will make our partnership easier to evolve further down the road.
                            </p>

                                Speaking of partnership, we believe in the power of connections with the leading players in the industry. As a consequence, we have invested vast amounts of time and screening to identify and establish strategic partnerships with what we believe to be the best out there in every corner of the MVNO industry. 
                            </p>

                                We are proud of providing that to the companies where we invest. Therefore, and as a part of the evaluation process of us we encourage you to also reach out to some of the entrepreneurs and industry players that we have already partnered with to hear what they have to say about us.
                            </p>

                                If we turn the arrow over, pointing to your direction, we are looking for great people with a determination and passion to change and challenge the industry. Our desired state is where there is already a team in place to set the sails. It will be windy and quick change of weather so a previous entrepreneurial experience is not a must, but definitely a plus.

                                However, if you are a solo entrepreneur with an idea that will break grounds and new to the game, we are of course all ears. It just might take a little more of mutual evaluation before we, potentially enters the dance floor.

                                MVNO is at the core of what we do. With a strong conviction that the development of MNVO’s across aspects are healthy for the overall development of the Telecom industry we are here to fuel the development of the most interesting start-ups.

                                We have decided to keep our investment scope tight as we want to be an active investor in the companies where we get the opportunity to invest. Why, we simply think that over time that will differentiate us as the best fit for MVNO entrepreneurs when deciding on investors to support your growth journey. However, and having said that we are open for opportunities that are adjacent to being an MVNO. What are the boundaries of that definition, maybe it is up to your creativity or imagination to decide.

                                Our focus in the life cycle is early. To maybe oversimplify reality, we see four distinct phases of an MVNO start-up. 1. Pre-MNO wholesale agreement, 2. Having accomplished a signed MNO wholesale agreement, 3. post-MNO wholesale agreement, ready to launch operations and a clear go to market plan at hand, 4. MVNO successfully launched, proof of concept at hand, scaling ahead.

                                Our experience is that a deciding on an investor takes time. Also, it is based on getting to know each other. As a consequence, we welcome early contacts, even in phase 1. The decision to invest from our end or you are letting us embark from your end might not be taken at this stage. However, with the experience we have from the industry and the network we bring to the table we believe that we can make your chances of reaching the next phase 2 stronger. Sometimes, even with a first release of funding to accelerate calendar time to reach phase 2. As such, we are typically, and desirably the first venture capitalist to invest.

Our experience is that forming a relationship leading to an investment can be a process of everything from a couple of months to over a year from first contact to getting investment ready from both ends.

To take the next step, we don’t have any specific format or required way to present your team and idea. However, and to move ahead we would need a high-quality business plan, including a financial role-up for us to assess.  We will not grade your business plan, but we believe that it works as a tool that will help us understand how ready you are to throw yourself out there. We believe that real numbers and user cases are stronger than projections. Further, we pay close attention to your view of the addressable market and your unique way to win in that market. We recommend that you submit your business plan using the format on our web page. This will then trigger the first step towards a potentially long haul, fruitful relationship.

                            Well, a little too early to discuss stages and steps on a life changing path we might end up experiencing together you might think. Yeah, maybe, but we tend to think that outlining what you can expect from us over the years to come will be beneficial for you as an entrepreneur when deciding among the range of investor options. Also from our perspective, this plays a healthy role. If we can, we would like to be clear with what we expect of a potential relationship from the start-ups we decide to invest in, out of the large number of invitations we receive from exciting companies.

                            Therefore, for us it is important to have a transparent, well described process of how we manage our evaluation, selection and the structure of the investment and attached life cycle support that we give those entrepreneurs we do decide to back. Alongside a set of principles of way of working as an active investor we have of course reserved room for important flexibility and creativity. We do believe that building strong companies requires a portion of structure, predictability and processes. As a consequence, we have established a few steps that we prefer to follow to gain traction.

                                    We receive a lot of very interesting business ideas. Many of them will turn out to be well functioning enterprises. Nevertheless, we are only investing in a small percentage of all the ideas that we come across. Simply because it is not that easy to come up with a great idea, backed by passionate people, a large addressable market waiting to be served, the right timing and a superior product. We promise though, that we will review all business plans. But only with the ones where we see a great potential we will ask for more details and work together with you and your team to further understand the important details behind your ideas and assumptions.

                                    This step is relevant from our perspective if we have managed to agree the terms for the investment stated in the term sheet. A due diligence simply means to double check and validate so that all key aspects and assumptions used for the offering in the term sheet is correct. This could be to review customer and partner contracts, assess IT security, perform background checks on key people associated with your start up etc.

                                    Given that the Due diligence went well we should be good to go from Amigos Venture Capital. The decision to invest in line with the terms agreed in the term sheet will be formally minuted in the Amigos Venture Capital Investment committee. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that when we make a decision to invest, we normally also consider the perspective of continuous investments in your company, ourselves or through associated investors.

You are now a well-established company with a loyal customer base, healthy p&l, good traction and appetite for further growth. A potential and common next step is to ensure further growth at a rapid pace. One way doing so is to use the success in the home market as a proof of concept for moving into other geographic markets. In this phase of international expansion another round of external capital is often required. We are happy to help you with the international expansion.

A major international expansion often requires a quite hefty additional financing round. Normally we would like to participate in this round. If the size of the financing need is large, we can do that together with co-investors within the Amigos Venture Capital network. Together with some of the leading international Venture Capital firms we can cater for also larger financing needs.

Either way, to cement or even reach the desired position within your home market might also require substantial additional funding.
